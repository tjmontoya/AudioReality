# AudioReality Overview

Enabling blind people to enjoy 'sightseeing' in their unique way by providing them with literary-pleasing descriptions of their surroundings. AudioReality is a mobile app that uses user location data to output descriptions of user's surroundings. Currently, backend logic exists, but front end features like text-to-speech are not yet implemented. We will discuss next steps at the bottom of this README.

## Overview of fils:

1. `flutter_files` contain our frontend files.
2. `python_files` contain our backend files.
3/ Audioreality_slides is our pitch deck.


## Getting started

The following are steps to run AudioReality locally, through an android/ios simulator. 

1. Download [flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Download [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for android emulator. For macbook users who would prefer ios emulator,download xcode by opening terminal and running `xcode-select â€”install`.
3. Clone repository.
4. Open terminal, and navigate to flutter root directory: `../AudioReality/flutter_files/geolocation_test/`, then execute `flutter run`. On emulator, flutter app should subsequently be built. There will an app in the homepage called 'geolocation_test'.
5. Open new terminal navigate to python root directory: `../AudioReality/python_files/`, and run `export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="ac37eca7ce769850a8c17bbbc9ab8e8e8658c9ba"`. This is the necessary API key. Once done, run 'python3 app.py'.
6. On emulator, press button "Get Location Data". After loading, app will output surrounding location description.
7. (Optional) xcode contains a change laptop location feature, which can be user to manually test for desriptions for different locations. Open macbook settings & select "set location". From there, type in the lattitud and longitude of desired location, then on AudioReality flutter app, click on "Get Location Data" button to output description of new location.
